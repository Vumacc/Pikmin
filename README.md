# About this repo
This is just a basic script that spams images of a red pikmin. \
I was extremely bored when I made this, so don't except quality.

# Stuff you need to know
To make it work you need to run it via IDLE. \
If too many tabs are opening go to your taskbar and select the Terminal, then close all tabs. \
If you want to stop the script you need to close IDLE window that pops up after you run the script.
