This is just a basic script that spams images of a red pikmin.

To make it work you need to run it via IDLE.
If too many tabs are opening go to your taskbar and select the Terminal, then close all tabs.

If you want to stop the script you need to close IDLE window that pops up after you run the script.

Sincerely,
